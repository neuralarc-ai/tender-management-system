Pioneering Generative AI Solutions for Enterprise Excellence

December 2025

About Neural Arc
Who We Are
Neural Arc is a specialized technology consultancy at the forefront of generative AI
innovation, dedicated to delivering cutting-edge artificial intelligence solutions for businesses
and enterprises worldwide. We are a team of expert AI engineers, data scientists, software
architects, and domain specialists who share a common vision: to make advanced AI
capabilities accessible, practical, and transformative for organizations of all sizes.
Founded on the principle that artificial intelligence should augment human capabilities rather
than replace them, Neural Arc has established itself as a trusted partner for organizations
seeking to leverage generative AI for operational excellence, innovation, and competitive
advantage. Our expertise spans the full spectrum of AI technologies, from natural language
processing and computer vision to predictive analytics and autonomous agents.

Our Generative AI Expertise
At Neural Arc, we specialize in generative AI—the transformative technology that enables
machines to create, reason, and solve problems with human-like intelligence. Our work goes
beyond traditional automation and rule-based systems. We design and implement AI solutions
that can understand context, learn from data, generate insights, and execute complex
workflows autonomously.

Introducing Helium AI
At the heart of our generative AI capabilities is Helium AI, our proprietary autonomous deep
agent platform that represents a breakthrough in intelligent automation. Helium is not just
another AI tool—it's a full-spectrum autonomous agent capable of understanding complex
requirements, planning multi-step workflows, and executing tasks across diverse domains
with minimal human intervention.

What Makes Helium Unique
Helium AI combines advanced reasoning capabilities with practical execution power, enabling
it to:
Understand Context: Helium comprehends nuanced requirements, interprets
ambiguous instructions, and asks clarifying questions when needed
Plan Intelligently: It breaks down complex tasks into logical steps, identifies
dependencies, and creates efficient execution plans
Execute Autonomously: Helium can perform research, analyze data, generate content,
write code, interact with systems, and deliver results—all without constant supervision
Learn and Adapt: The platform continuously improves its performance based on
feedback and outcomes
Integrate Seamlessly: Helium connects with existing enterprise systems through APIs,
databases, and standard protocols

Helium for Business & Enterprise
Helium AI is specifically designed for business and enterprise environments where reliability,
security, and compliance are paramount. Unlike consumer-focused AI tools, Helium is built
with enterprise requirements in mind:

Helium for End Users
While Helium is powerful enough for complex enterprise workflows, it's also designed to be
accessible to end users. Through natural language interfaces, users can interact with Helium
conversationally, asking questions, requesting information, and delegating tasks without
needing technical expertise. This dual capability—enterprise-grade power with consumergrade simplicity—makes Helium uniquely valuable for organizations serving diverse

stakeholder groups.

Our Commitment to Excellence

At Neural Arc, we don't just deliver technology—we deliver transformation. Every project is
an opportunity to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI, while maintaining the
highest standards of quality, security, and user experience. Our success is measured not by
the sophistication of our technology, but by the tangible value we create for our clients and
their stakeholders.

Understanding the RFQ
Project Context
The Department of Health (DoH) seeks a qualified technology partner to recover, complete,
and deploy the partially developed International Patient Care (IPC) System built on the
OutSystems platform. This is a critical system that manages the complete lifecycle of
international patient treatment, from initial request through treatment completion and followup.

Current Situation
The IPC system is currently under development but has encountered delivery challenges that
require additional expertise to bring the system to full completion. DoH requires a partner
who can:
Assess the current state of the partially developed system
Identify salvageable components versus those requiring rework
Complete remaining functional requirements
Integrate with multiple internal and external systems
Ensure security, compliance, and performance standards are met
Deliver an MVP as quickly as possible
Provide comprehensive training and knowledge transfer

Key Stakeholders
The IPC system serves multiple stakeholder groups, each with distinct needs:
Stakeholder
Group

Patients &
Families

Key Needs

Submit treatment requests online, Track application status in real-time,
Access medical documents and approvals, Receive notifications and
updates, Request certificates and support
Medical committee evaluation, Case coordination and management, Travel

DoH Staff

and logistics coordination, Financial authorization and tracking,
Performance monitoring and reporting

Healthcare

Receive treatment referrals, Schedule appointments, Submit medical

Providers

reports, Coordinate with DoH, Track patient progress

Service

Travel agents for booking services, Insurance companies for coverage,

Providers

Banking partners for payments, Government agencies for data exchange

Scope of Work - Our Understanding
Based on our comprehensive analysis of the RFQ document, we have mapped the
requirements into the following scope of work:

1. System Recovery & Assessment
WHAT WE UNDERSTAND
The IPC system is partially developed on OutSystems platform
Business Requirements Documents (BRDs) are already prepared and validated
Some components are functional while others require remediation or completion
DoH resources are embedded in the project and will work alongside the vendor
This is a co-delivery engagement, not a complete rebuild

OUR APPROACH
Conduct comprehensive assessment within first 2 weeks
Apply salvage vs. rebuild framework to each component
Prioritize quick wins and accelerate MVP delivery
Leverage existing BRDs and DoH business analysts
Integrate seamlessly with DoH embedded resources

2. Core Functional Requirements
The IPC system must support the complete patient treatment journey with the following key
capabilities:

PATIENT TREATMENT JOURNEY
1. Registration & Authentication - Multi-role access with UAE Pass, Active
Directory, and OTP verification
2. Treatment Request Submission - Online forms with document upload, autopopulation from government sources, multilingual support
3. Medical Committee Evaluation - Review by DoH medical experts, integration
with Malaffi/DHA/MOHAP for medical history, approval/rejection workflow
4. Case Coordination - Assignment to coordinators, hospital appointment scheduling,
document preparation
5. Travel Coordination - Visa processing, flight and hotel booking, transportation
arrangements through approved agents
6. Treatment & Support - Per-diem management, prepaid card issuance, escort
coordination, ongoing communication
7. Post-Treatment - Medical report collection, certificate generation, follow-up
notifications, complaint handling

3. Integration Requirements
The IPC system must integrate with 10+ external systems to enable seamless data exchange
and workflow automation:
