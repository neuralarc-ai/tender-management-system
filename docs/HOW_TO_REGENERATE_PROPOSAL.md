# 🎯 Quick Fix - Get Proper AI Proposal

## What You're Seeing:
You're seeing the OLD AI-generated content that was created with the previous prompt. It shows meta-commentary instead of an actual proposal.

## How to Fix:

### **Click "Regenerate with AI" Button**

1. On the Proposals page
2. With "Enterprise Cloud Migration Strategy" selected
3. Click the purple **"Regenerate with AI"** button
4. Wait 1-5 minutes
5. The NEW proposal will be generated with the improved prompt

### **What You'll Get:**

**Executive Summary** will now start with:
> "Neural Arc Inc is pleased to present this proposal for Enterprise Cloud Migration Strategy. With our proven expertise demonstrated through projects like ipc.he2.ai and ers.he2.ai..."

Instead of:
> "Perfect! Now I have the context..."

### **Why This Happened:**

- First generation used old prompt (AI was thinking aloud)
- I fixed the prompt to generate proper proposals
- You need to regenerate to get the new format

---

## ✅ **After Regenerating:**

You'll see professional proposal content in all tabs:
- **Executive**: Compelling summary referencing ipc.he2.ai
- **Technical**: Detailed architecture for PDF + Website
- **Timeline**: Phased delivery schedule
- **Commercial**: Investment breakdown
